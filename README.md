Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

A desktop application built with Python to simulate and compare popular page replacement algorithms such as **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **Optimal**. Designed for students and OS learners, the simulator provides **interactive GUI**, **visual analytics**, and **exportable performance reports** — making operating systems fun and easy to understand.



Project Objective

- Simulate and visualize how different page replacement algorithms work.
- Help users understand memory management in operating systems through graphs and statistics.
- Allow easy input of custom reference strings and frame sizes.
- Provide downloadable results for reports or assignments.


Features
 FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithm simulation  
 Beautiful Tkinter GUI  
 Step-by-step algorithm execution  
 Graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
 CSV export of analysis results  
  Comparative statistics: Page faults, hit/miss ratio

How to Run the Project

 Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/chirugeek463/OS-Project.git
cd OS-Project


Step 2: Install Required Libraries

pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas


tep 3: Run the Application

python main.py

The GUI window will open — enter your reference string, choose an algorithm, set the number of frames, and click simulate!
->>If required create a virtual environment 
->>python3 -m venv myenv 
->>source myenv/bin/activate - to activate the virtual environment 
->>deactivate - to deactivate
